This repository contains the official training/evaluation code of the Imp project, which aims to provide a family of a strong multimodal small language models (MSLMs). Our `imp-v1-3b` is a strong MSLM with only **3B** parameters, which is build upon a small yet powerful SLM [Phi-2](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/phi-2) (2.7B) and a powerful visual encoder [SigLIP](https://huggingface.co/google/siglip-so400m-patch14-384) (0.4B), and trained on the [LLaVA-v1.5](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA) training set.  

As shown in the [Evaluation](#evaluation), `imp-v1-3b` significantly outperforms the counterparts of similar model sizes, and even achieves slightly better performance than the strong LLaVA-7B model on various multimodal benchmarks. 

We also release the model weights a running example of `imp-v1-3b` on [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/MILVLG/imp-v1-3b/). Technical report will be released soon. We will persistently improve our model and release the next versions to further improve model performance :)

## Prerequisites

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the folder 
``` shell
git clone https://github.com/MILVLG/imp.git
cd imp
```
2. Install Package

We recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) to create a new environment for the project, and install the requirements with the following commands:
``` shell
conda create -n imp python=3.10 -y
conda activate imp
pip install -r requirements.txt
conda install -c nvidia cuda
which nvcc # cut bin/nvcc, rest set to CUDA_HOME, e.g export CUDA_HOME=/opt/conda/envs/imp
pip install flash-attn==2.4.2 --no-build-isolation
```

3. Download the pretrained base models (i.e., Phi-2 and SigLIP) to your local directories. **Note that the latest version of the Phi-2 model is not compatible with this repository. We strongly recommend using the following script to download the specific versions of the base models.** 
``` shell
python scripts/download_models.py
```
The base models will be stored in `checkpoints/base` in default.
```
checkpoints
â””â”€â”€ base
    â””â”€â”€ siglip-so400m-patch14-384
    â””â”€â”€ phi-2
```
## Model-zoo
The checkpoints of different Imp models are provided in [Model_Zoo.md](./docs/Model_Zoo.md) .

## Training
The training pipeline and datasets of `imp-v1-3b` are directly inherited from [LLaVA-v1.5](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA). The training  
- *Multimodal pretraining*: train a projector on a subset of âˆ¼558K image-text pairs to connect a frozen pretrained vision encoder and a frozen LLM.
- *Multimodal instruction tuning*: fine-tune the projector and LoRA in the LLM with multimodal instruction data and VQA-formatted data to empower the MLSM the ability of multimodal instruction following.

Imp is trained on 8 A100 (40G) GPUs. You can reduce the `per_device_train_batch_size` and increase the `gradient_accumulation_steps` to match your resources. .But always keep the global batch size the same: `global_batch_size ` = `per_device_train_batch_size` $`\times`$ `gradient_accumulation_steps` $`\times`$ `num_gpus`.

<summary>Training scripts </summary>

### Stage-1: Multimodal pretraining

Please download the caption annotations `blip_laion_cc_sbu_558k.json` and images from [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/liuhaotian/LLaVA-Pretrain). Move the downloaded files to the `./datasets` folder, with image folder unzipped and renamed to `pretrain_images`. Then run the following command to start the training process:

``` shell
bash scripts/pretrain.sh
```

After that, a checkpoint file will be stored in `./checkpoints/imp-v1-3b-stage1`.

### Stage-2: Multimodal instruction tuning

Please download the annotation file of the mixed instruction tuning data [llava_v1_5_mix665k.json](https://huggingface.co/datasets/liuhaotian/LLaVA-Instruct-150K/blob/main/llava_v1_5_mix665k.json), and download the images from constituting datasets:

- COCO: [train2017](http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/train2017.zip)
- GQA: [images](https://downloads.cs.stanford.edu/nlp/data/gqa/images.zip)
- OCR-VQA: [download script](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_GYPY5UkUy7HIcR0zq3ZCFgeZN7BAfm_?usp=sharing), **save all files as `.jpg`**
- TextVQA: [train_val_images](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/textvqa/images/train_val_images.zip)
- VisualGenome: [part1](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/rak248/VG_100K_2/images.zip), [part2](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/rak248/VG_100K_2/images2.zip)

After downloading all of them, organize the data as follows:

```
datasets
â”œâ”€â”€ llava_v1_5_mix665k.json
â””â”€â”€ finetune_images
    â”œâ”€â”€ coco
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ train2017
    â”œâ”€â”€ gqa
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ images
    â”œâ”€â”€ ocr_vqa
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ images
    â”œâ”€â”€ textvqa
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ train_images
    â””â”€â”€ vg
        â”œâ”€â”€ VG_100K
        â””â”€â”€ VG_100K_2
```

Then, you can start the training process by the following script. If you use your custom dataset, you can refer to `llava_v1_5_mix665k.json` to format your data.

``` shell
bash scripts/finetune_lora.sh
# bash scripts/finetune.sh # fully finetuning is not recommended
```
You will get a trained model `imp-v1-3b-stage2-lora` (a LoRA diff if you use `finetune_lora.sh`) under `./checkpoints/` when the training is done.

### Submodel merging
After the above model training, the model checkpoint consists of multiple sub-models. You can use the following script to merge the stage2 sub-models into a single one for release. Our evaluation script supports both the sub-models and merged model checkpoints. **However, if you want to fine-tune the model on your own custom dataset, only the merged model is supported.** 

``` shell
bash scripts/merge.sh
```
After that, a checkpoint file will be stored in `./checkpoints/imp-v1-3b`.

### Finetuning on custom datasets
You also can finetune Imp using your own custom dataset use `finetune_lora_custom.sh`. The custom dataset should be in the LLaVA-1.5 format.    

``` shell
bash scripts/finetune_lora_custom.sh
```

## Evaluation
We follow the evaluation of [LLaVA-v1.5](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/tree/main) and conduct experiments on 9 commonly-used benchmarks, including 5 academic VQA benchmarks and 4 popular MLLM benchmarks. All evaluation scripts are placed in the `scripts/eval` folder. 

Before preparing task-specific data, you should download [eval.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1atZSBBrAX54yYpxtVVW33zFvcnaHeFPy/view?usp=sharing) and unzip it to `./playground/data/eval`. For more specific instructions, please refer to [LLaVA's Evaluation.md](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/blob/main/docs/Evaluation.md). 

It is supported to evaluate your reproduced model checkpoints or our released model. For more detailed evaluation scripts, please refer to [Evaluation.md](./docs/Evaluation.md).

Using our provided model, you can reproduce the following results. Our `imp-v1-3b` model significantly outperforms existing MSLMs of similar model sizes, and is comparable with the strong LLaVA-v1.5-7b model.
